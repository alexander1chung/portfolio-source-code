          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hi I'm Alex!</p>
          <p>
            My Software Engineering story began in 2019, during my last semester
            at USC. Where at the time I was handling two businesses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A tutoring business which I scaled to{" "}
              <strong>35+ students</strong> over the course of{" "}
              <strong>6 years</strong>.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Teaching students direct <strong>application</strong> of
                  scientific theory.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              And a dropshipping business which I started a year prior.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Months of planning, <strong>communication</strong> with
                  suppliers and <strong>execution</strong>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Juggling the two businesses alongside school proved to be difficult
            as I found their models to be <strong>unsustainable</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally I was also taking a challenging Neural Interfacing
            className which <strong>exploited</strong> my pre-existing beliefs
            on what was possible through code. There was one particular
            assignment where we extrapolated electrical impulse propagation
            throughout the brain. Something which I thought was{" "}
            <strong>not possible</strong>, but there it was, a script, that
            consistently reproduced results, was <strong>distributable</strong>{" "}
            and replicable <strong>anywhere</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            And from that moment I had a realization and started investing
            heavily in my programming prowess. I built websites in PHP 7 paired
            with MySQL and HTML/CSS and after becoming proficient I was able to
            find an internship as a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> where I
            built out components and integrated Charts. After the internship, I
            decided to learn more about the <strong>Full Stack</strong> at{" "}
            <strong>Hack Reactor</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to today, I'm a seasoned Software Engineer and have
            experience as the Technical lead for various projects and startups.
